Hi, I’m Carlos Daniel.

I am passionate about becoming a skilled Python programmer and developing diverse projects to continuously learn and share my ideas with the world.

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Fatec São Paulo, Brazil. I also study Python independently and learn JavaScript as part of my university curriculum.

I have a strong interest in databases, automation, and backend development.

I am eager to collaborate on projects with other developers and companies to grow my programming experience and learn from others.

Feel free to reach out to me via email: coltbuull@gmail.com
 or send me a message directly on GitHub.

Pronouns: he/him

Fun fact: I speak four languages — Portuguese (native), English, French, and Spanish — and I am currently learning German.

I love working with technology and constantly challenge myself to grow.
I have always enjoyed learning languages and facing challenges. Although I studied many human languages, programming languages became my newest passion and motivation.
Today, I focus on Python and backend development, but through university, I also developed a strong interest in JavaScript, which has become an exciting challenge for me.
Technology offers endless opportunities, and I am committed to studying and evolving to stay ahead.
